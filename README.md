# üè• Hospital Readmission Predictor

A machine learning-powered web app for predicting a diabetic patient's risk of hospital readmission. The app uses **XGBoost** for modeling, **SHAP** for model explanations, and **Streamlit** for an interactive user interface.

## Features

- **Streamlit UI:** Clean, interactive form for patient data entry and risk prediction.
- **XGBoost Model:** Trained on real hospital data to predict readmission risk.
- **SHAP Explanations:** Visualize key features affecting predictions.
- **Immediate Feedback:** Get risk assessment and explanation with a click.

## Tech Stack

- Python (main codebase)
- Streamlit (UI)
- XGBoost (ML model)
- SHAP (model interpretability)
- Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn (data processing)
- Joblib (model serialization)
- Matplotlib (plots)
- Pillow (image handling)

## Usage

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install streamlit pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost shap joblib matplotlib pillow
```

### 2. Prepare Data and Train Model

- Place your dataset as `diabetic_data.csv` in the project directory.
- Run the model training script:

```bash
python train_model.py
```

This will:
- Clean and preprocess the data
- Train an XGBoost classifier
- Save the model (`readmission_model.pkl`), feature columns (`model_columns.pkl`), and a SHAP summary plot (`shap_summary_plot.png`)

### 3. Run the Web App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

- Fill in patient details in the UI.
- Click **Predict Readmission**.
- See immediate risk prediction and explanation plot.

## Input Features

- Age, Gender, Admission Type/Source, Discharge Disposition
- Time in Hospital, Number of Lab Procedures, Prior Inpatient Visits
- Number of Diagnoses, Max Glucose Serum, A1C Result, Medication Change, Diabetes Medication

## Model Explanation

- Predictions are explained using SHAP, showing the top factors influencing risk for the given patient.
- SHAP summary plot is displayed if available.

## Code Structure

- `app.py`: Streamlit app for UI and prediction
- `train_model.py`: Data cleaning, model training, saving artifacts
- `diabetic_data.csv`: Input data (not included)
- `readmission_model.pkl`, `model_columns.pkl`, `shap_summary_plot.png`: Generated by training script

## Example Workflow

1. Train the model on your data.
2. Launch the Streamlit app.
3. Enter patient details, predict risk, and view explanations.
